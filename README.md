I am wanting to make this a framework for setting niceness and affinity based on rulesets. The initial attempt is to do this based on what cores are least and most used. I am
fairly new to python and very new to building a "project". I will be trying to use a setup.py, requirements.txt etc but at this time I will be trying to get a working
model of autonice.py that will adjust based on least/most used cores and stats gathered with psutil.
